#
# This is the global configuration file for CapiSuite
#
# Some general options will be set here, which define which scripts
# to use, when to start them and what to log and where.
#
# All other options are defined in the python scripts given here
# or (preferably) are read from them from some other configuration
# files.
#
# As usual, lines starting with # or empty lines will be ignored 
#
# The rest must be key value pairs written as key=value.
#
# Additional whitespaces and quotation marks (") surrounding
# the values will be ignored.

# incoming_script
#
# This python script will be called when an incoming call occurs.
#
# It must define a python function named "callIncoming".
#
incoming_script="@pkglibdir@/incoming.py"

# idle_script
#
# This python script will be called in regular intervals giving
# you the ability to search for needed actions (like send fax)
# in a queue (or somewhere else) and initiate the calls.
#
# It must define a python function named "idle". It's allowed
# to use the same script for incoming_script and idle_script
#
idle_script="@pkglibdir@/idle.py"

# idle_script_interval
#
# The given idle_script will be called in regular intervals.
#
# The length of the intervals in seconds is given here. If you
# don't want to use an idle script, set it to "0"
#
idle_script_interval="30"

# log_file
#
# The file given here is used for writing normal log messages to.
#
log_file="@localstatedir@/log/capisuite.log"

# log_level
#
# Selects how chatty CapiSuite will be:
#
# 0 = only very few messages (e.g. system start/stop)
# 1 = some important messages (e.g. connection start/end)
# 2 = many debug messages (nearly every CAPI message logged)
# 3 = all debug messages (all CAPI messages - include every transmitted data package, every script execution)
log_level="1"

# log_error
#
# The file given here is used for writing error messages to.
#
# Error messages are separated so you can easily find them.
#
log_error="@localstatedir@/log/capisuite.error"

# DDI_base, DDI_length and DDI_stop_numbers
#
# The following two options are only important if you've your ISDN card connected
# to an ISDN interface which is configured in "Point to Point"-mode (in Germany
# this is called "Anlagenanschluss"). This means you don't have several
# specific numbers (so called MSNs) but only one base number and you can define
# extensions as you like. As the length of these extensions is up to you, CapiSuite
# can't know it. Therefore you must configure it here. Sometimes, there are also
# shorter numbers you want to allow, for example the extension "0" instead of "000".
# These extension numbers can be listed (separated by commas) in DDI_stop_numbers. 
#
# If you don't understand what this all means, then you most likely have no PtP 
# interface and you can leave the default values.
# 
# As an example, if you've numbers like 12345-123 and 12345-111, then your 
# DDI_base_length would be "5" and DDI_length would be 3. If you also want to
# receive calls to 12345-0, you should set DDI_stop_numbers to "0".  
#
# A value of 0 for DDI_length disables this feature and the other settings are
# ignored then (default).
DDI_length="0"
DDI_base_length="0" 
DDI_stop_numbers=""
