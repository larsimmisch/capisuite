===

	* scripts: removed the special support for giving an empty voice_email/
	  fax_email parameter. This is NOT allowed any more and will result in
	  an error when sending the mail. Simply don't set these parameters
	  any more if you don't need them!

	* scripts: remote inquiry now uses correct female form ("eine Nachricht"
	  instead of "eins Nachricht", thx to Eckhard Rggeberg and J�g Fester)

	* scripts: capisuitefax now submits a single job if several
	  files are given (implemented by Hartmut Goebel, fixes bug #38)

        * scripts: New script capisuite-checkconfig for checking the
          configuration (thx to carsten@capimin.cbclass.net for the
          idea and a first version, improved by Hartmut Goebel).

	* core: major refactoring of the Python based interface has
          been done. Now a complete new Python module library
          implements a lot of useful functions and offers handy
          abstractions. (planned and implemented by Hartmut Goebel)

	* scripts: the mails sent can now be configured in the special sections
	  MailFaxReceived, MailFaxSent, MailFaxFailed and MailVoiceReceived in
	  answering_machine.conf and fax.conf (implemented by Hartmut Goebel)

	* scripts: the mails sent with received voice and fax calls will now
	  contain some general information like length of calls, number of
	  pages, etc. (thx to Achim Bohnet and Thomas Niesel for the feature
	  requests; closes bug #6 finally)

	* core: the Python functions switch_to_faxG3, fax_receive, fax_send,
	  audio_send and audio_receive now return some informational data about
	  the transfer

	* core: the Python functions will now only throw the CallGoneError
	  exception when a hangup is NOT expected; this means many functions
	  like faxReceive() will now finish normally when no call abort happens

	* core: accept incoming color faxes now

	* started a detailed ChangeLog file from 2003-10-05. From now on, NEWS
	  should only contain important changes from a user's point of view, while
	  ChangeLog records all changes in detail.

0.4.5
=====

	* documentation: 5 man pages are now also created: capisuite(8),
	  capisuite.conf(5), fax.conf(5), answering_machine.conf(5),
	  capisuitefax(1) (fixes bug #13, thx to Achim Bohnet for reporting)

	* scripts: prevent cropping of fax pages by auto-scaling

	* scripts: use a SMTP connection to localhost instead of calling the
	  sendmail binary for sending mails. Many reports showed that calling
	  sendmail manually doesn't work well on quite some systems

	* scripts: capisuitefax now also accepts PDF files (thx to Jochen Meyer
	  and Eckhard Rggeberg for reporting)

	* core: behave correctly when DATA_B3_CONF messages come early (thx to
	  Karsten Keil for analyzing and a nice fix!)

	* core: fixed a bug which could lead to a crash when some unexpected
	  CAPI messages arrived (thx to Karsten Keil for analyzing)

	* core: fixed compile problem with new capi4linux library

	* core: fixed a crash which could be caused by wrong DDI parameters
	  in capisuite.conf
	
	* scripts: Adapted to work with the new parameters of sfftobmp 3.x.
	  Normally, installed version will be detected automatically when 
	  building CapiSuite. If you change your sfftobmp version later,  
	  you'll have to adapt the function sfftotif at the beginning of
	  cs_helpers.py manually.

	* scripts: added new options "fax_email_from" and "voice_email_from" to
	  answering_machine.conf and fax.conf (thx to Achim Bohnet for submitting
	  a patch with this feature!; closes bug #46)
	
	* core: use shorter, more readable format for Python traceback logging

0.4.4
=====

        * Makefiles: fixed "make" to not trying to create directories any more -
          this prevented normal users to call "make" sometimes (thx to Steffen
          Barszus for the detailled report)

        * scripts: added new non-error ISDN cause (0x349f) to fax send routine.
          It was wrongly understood as an error before and therefore leading to
          repeated fax sends (thx to Stefan Brandner for reporting)

        * scripts: fixed a bug which lead to a connection abort when the
          answering machine recognized an incoming fax call (thx to Andreas
          Scholz and Harald Jansen)

        * scripts: fixed a bug which under some circumstances caused an error
          message when fax_numbers was not set for a user

        * scripts: received voice calls are now converted to 16 bit WAV files
          instead of 8 bit; this leads to a dramatically better playback quality
          for the sound files attached to the sent mails (thx to Holger Krull
          for the fix; closes bug #51)

        * core: support for ISDN lines with DDI (means you only have one base
	  number - not a list of MSNs - and can define extensions how you like;
	  in Germany used in the "Anlagenanschluss"). We now have three new
	  DDI_* options in capisuite.conf. Many thanks goes to J�g Fester and
	  the x-dot GmbH for paying and supporting me to develop this feature.
	  They use CapiSuite in their product (see http://www.x-manage.de).

0.4.3 (CVS tag CAPISUITE_043):
==============================

	* scripts & core: support color fax reception (bug #22, thx to
	  Axel Schneck)

	* scripts: added missing file "unbekannt.la" to install targets in
	  Makefiles (thx to Wolfgang Dollendorf)

	* scripts: added missing "+.la" which is necessary for the remote
	  inquiry of recorded international calls (bug #27)

	* scripts: fax_numbers may be now left empty in fax.conf. This makes
	  it possible to use one MSN for receiving/sending faxes and voice
	  calls (fax sending was refused up to now if fax_numbers was empty).
	  (bug #23)

	* scripts: number of needed tries reported after sending a fax was
	  wrong (bug #29, thx to Eckhard Rggeberg)

	* scripts: fax jobs can be given a literal addressee and a subject
	  for informational purposes now (bug #18 reported by Achim Bohnet)

	* core: fax headline is now converted to the right charset internally,
	  so that special characters like german umlauts are working now
	  (thx to Eckhard Rggeberg for reporting)

	* scripts: Sander Roest found a workaround for the odd Python error
	  "cannot unmarshal code objects in restricted execution mode" which
	  mainly hit Redhat users for any reason beyond my understanding and
	  prevented CapiSuite from sending mails sometimes/always...

	* switched from BerliOS bug tracker to Mantis installed on http://www.
	  capisuite.de

0.4.2 (CVS tag CAPISUITE_042):
==============================
	* manual now available as PDF

	* scripts: fixed an overflow in cs_helpery.py which caused hangs for
          the receive of long (more than about 40 pages) fax documents

	* scripts: fixed a bug in idle.py which caused a fax send delay of one
	  hour when daylight saving time is in effect

	* scripts: attachments to sent e-mails now get a valid filename

	* scripts: the *_email settings from fax.conf and answering_machine.conf
	  now allow to set multiple addresses to send the mails to

	* scripts: the "*_numbers" settings from fax.conf and answering_machine.conf
	  now support the special sign "-" for "no destination number available"
	  (e.g. needed for the austrian "Global Call")

	* scripts: capisuitefax now handles filenames and dialstrings with
	  special chars (spaces etc.) correctly

	* scripts: new parameter "--user" added to capisuitefax; thx to Wolfgang
	  Eul for the patch!

	* core: use "-" instead of "??" for "no number available", e.g.
	  important for the call_from and call_to parameters of scripts

	* core: small bug which lead to a wrong outgoing MSN in rare cases fixed

0.4.1a (tag CAPISUITE_041a):
============================
	* fixed a bug in the rc-script of CapiSuite which made
          "capisuite start" unfunctional in 0.4.1 (path of executable changed)

	* included tests and changes for gcc-2.95, no patch necessary
          any more to build CapiSuite with it

	* CapiSuite now checks controller abilities and respects them
          when connecting (e.g. use extended fax protocols if available)
	  -> this also works around a severe crash with AVM drivers when
             transmitting a fax to/from some analog devices

	* fixed SECURITY bug in cronjob which allowed every CapiSuite user
          to become root. Sorry... :-((

0.4.1 (tag CAPISUITE_041):
==========================
	* cron script: redirect error output to /dev/null

        * core: cosmetical code improvements to make old gcc-2.95 more happy
        * core: fixed problems when doing "make install" to an arbitrary prefix
        * core: moved "capisuite" to <prefix>/sbin instead of bin

	* scripts: fixed idle.py freezing which lead to CapiSuite not sending
	  faxes any more after some time (#527)
	* scripts: fixed remote inquiry: mixed new and old messages sometimes
	* scripts: stricter permissions of received files and dirs (#544)
	* scripts: new option dial_prefix implemented (#537)
	* scripts: better check for options read from config files, (#531)
	  many options are optional now with a resonable default
	* scripts: capisuitefax shebang corrected (#536)

Thanks goes mainly to Achim Bohnet and Dieter Pelzel for reporting bugs

	  dates and times are now said nearly correctly for the remote inquiry
	* scripts: fixed a typo in incoming.py
	* docs: added ISDN/CAPI error codes to manual

0.3 (internal release):
